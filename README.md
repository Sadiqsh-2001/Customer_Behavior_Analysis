# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data Analytics Project | Python | SQL | Power BI | Excel

📊 Data Analytics Project

1. Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow — from raw dataset loading to business insights visualization and reporting.
The objective was to:
Load and explore a dataset using Python
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Clean and transform the data
Execute SQL queries in PostgreSQL
Build an interactive Power BI dashboard
Create a final analytical report
Present findings using a PPT (created with Gamma)
This project highlights practical data analysis skills aligned with real-world business scenarios.

2. Dataset

Source: [Mention source – e.g., Kaggle / Internal dataset / Public dataset]
Format: CSV
Records: [Number of rows]
Features: [Number of columns]
The dataset includes structured business data such as:
Customer information
Transactions / Sales
Product details
Dates and categories
The data required cleaning, transformation, and validation before analysis.

3. Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data loading, cleaning, EDA
PostgreSQL	Running analytical SQL queries
Power BI	Dashboard creation & visualization
Gamma	Presentation (PPT) creation
Excel (Optional)	Quick validation & checks

5. Project Steps

Step 1: Data Loading (Python)
Imported dataset using Pandas
Checked structure using .info(), .describe()
Identified missing values and data types

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution analysis
Outlier detection
Correlation analysis
Category-wise performance comparison
Trend analysis over time

Step 3: Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates
Handled missing values
Standardized formats (dates, text)
Corrected inconsistent values
Created derived columns (if required)

Step 4: SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
Imported cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL
Executed queries involving:
Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
GROUP BY and HAVING
Window functions
Business KPIs calculation
Extracted insights for reporting

Step 5: Power BI Dashboard
Connected to PostgreSQL / cleaned dataset
Built interactive visuals:
KPI cards
Trend charts
Category comparisons
Filters & slicers
Focused on business storytelling

Step 6: Reporting & Presentation
Documented insights in a structured report
Created a professional presentation using Gamma
Highlighted:
Key findings
Business impact
Recommendations

5. Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:
📈 Revenue / Performance trends
📊 Category-wise breakdown
🧮 Key KPIs (Total Sales, Avg Value, Growth %)
🎯 Filters for dynamic analysis
The dashboard is designed for business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions quickly.

6. Key Results & Insights

Identified top-performing categories/products
Highlighted seasonal trends
Detected underperforming segments
Provided recommendations for revenue improvement
Quantified performance differences using SQL-based metrics
This project demonstrates the ability to move from raw data to actionable business insights.
